### Polar Sensor App

The Polar Sensor App Android application developed as part of the final lab assignment in the course Mobile Applications and Wireless Networks during my final year of my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. The app is built in Kotlin and measures arm movement angles (0° to 90°) using either a connected Polar sensor or the phone’s internal sensors. It allows users to choose their preferred sensor, connects via Bluetooth for external devices, and stores measurement data locally using Room Database.
